lorenz
======

This contains the implementation of the 40-variable and multi-scale models
of Edward Lorenz. These depend on Fortran 95 code, which need to be built into
modules.


1. Navigate to the lorenz directory.
2. Execute the python setup file as follows:

        python setup.py build_ext --inplace

3. You may remove the build folder.
